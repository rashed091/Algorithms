    "Analysis of Sequential Search\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze searching algorithms, we need to decide on a basic unit of\n",
    "computation. Recall that this is typically the common step that must be\n",
    "repeated in order to solve the problem. For searching, it makes sense to\n",
    "count the number of comparisons performed. Each comparison may or may\n",
    "not discover the item we are looking for. In addition, we make another\n",
    "assumption here. The list of items is not ordered in any way. The items\n",
    "have been placed randomly into the list. In other words, the probability\n",
    "that the item we are looking for is in any particular position is\n",
    "exactly the same for each position of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the item is not in the list, the only way to know it is to compare it\n",
    "against every item present. If there are $$n$$ items, then the sequential\n",
    "search requires $$n$$ comparisons to discover that the item is not there.\n",
    "In the case where the item is in the list, the analysis is not so\n",
    "straightforward. There are actually three different scenarios that can\n",
    "occur. In the best case we will find the item in the first place we\n",
    "look, at the beginning of the list. We will need only one comparison. In\n",
    "the worst case, we will not discover the item until the very last\n",
    "comparison, the nth comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the average case? On average, we will find the item about\n",
    "halfway into the list; that is, we will compare against $$\\frac{n}{2}$$\n",
    "items. Recall, however, that as *n* gets large, the coefficients, no\n",
    "matter what they are, become insignificant in our approximation, so the\n",
