    "A **hash table** is a collection of items which are stored in such a way\n",

    "\n",
    "Hash Functions\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a collection of items, a hash function that maps each item into a\n",
    "unique slot is referred to as a **perfect hash function**. If we know\n",
    "the items and the collection will never change, then it is possible to\n",
    "construct a perfect hash function (refer to the exercises for more about\n",
    "perfect hash functions). Unfortunately, given an arbitrary collection of\n",
    "items, there is no systematic way to construct a perfect hash function.\n",
    "Luckily, we do not need the hash function to be perfect to still gain\n",
    "performance efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to always have a perfect hash function is to increase the size\n",
    "of the hash table so that each possible value in the item range can be\n",
    "accommodated. This guarantees that each item will have a unique slot.\n",
    "Although this is practical for small numbers of items, it is not\n",
    "feasible when the number of possible items is large. For example, if the\n",
    "items were nine-digit Social Security numbers, this method would require\n",
    "almost one billion slots. If we only want to store data for a class of\n",
    "25 students, we will be wasting an enormous amount of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to create a hash function that minimizes the number of\n",
    "collisions, is easy to compute, and evenly distributes the items in the\n",
    "hash table. There are a number of common ways to extend the simple\n",
    "remainder method. We will consider a few of them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **folding method** for constructing hash functions begins by\n",
    "dividing the item into equal-size pieces (the last piece may not be of\n",
    "equal size). These pieces are then added together to give the resulting\n",
    "hash value. For example, if our item was the phone number 436-555-4601,\n",
    "we would take the digits and divide them into groups of 2\n",
    "(43,65,55,46,01). After the addition, $43+65+55+46+01$, we get 210. If\n",
    "we assume our hash table has 11 slots, then we need to perform the extra\n",
    "step of dividing by 11 and keeping the remainder. In this case\n",
    "$210\\ \\%\\ 11$ is 1, so the phone number 436-555-4601 hashes to slot 1.\n",
    "Some folding methods go one step further and reverse every other piece\n",
    "before the addition. For the above example, we get\n",
    "$43+56+55+64+01 = 219$ which gives $219\\ \\%\\ 11 = 10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another numerical technique for constructing a hash function is called\n",
    "the **mid-square method**. We first square the item, and then extract\n",
    "some portion of the resulting digits. For example, if the item were 44,\n",
    "we would first compute $44 ^{2} = 1,936$. By extracting the middle two\n",
    "digits, 93, and performing the remainder step, we get 5 ($93\\ \\%\\ 11$).\n",
    "The table below shows items under both the remainder\n",
    "method and the mid-square method. You should verify that you understand\n",
    "how these values were computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Item  |  Remainder |  Mid-Square\n",
    "--- | --- | ---\n",
    "54 | 10 | 3\n",
    "26 | 4  | 7\n",
    "93 | 5  | 9\n",
    "17 | 6  | 8\n",
    "77 | 0  | 4\n",
    "31 | 9  | 6\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create hash functions for character-based items such as\n",
    "strings. The word “cat” can be thought of as a sequence of ordinal\n",
    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> ord('c')\n",
    "99\n",
    ">>> ord('a')\n",
    "97\n",
    ">>> ord('t')\n",
    "116\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then take these three ordinal values, add them up, and use the\n",
    "remainder method to get a hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hashing a string using ordinal values](figures/string-hash.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a function called `hash` that takes a string and a table size and\n",
    "returns the hash value in the range from 0 to `tablesize - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def hash(astring, tablesize):\n",
    "    the_sum = sum(ord(char) for char in astring)\n",
    "    return the_sum % tablesize\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to note that when using this hash function, anagrams\n",
    "will always be given the same hash value. To remedy this, we could use\n",
    "the position of the character as a weight.\n",
    "The illustration below shows one possible way to use the\n",
    "positional value as a weighting factor. The modification to the `hash`\n",
    "function is left as an exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hashing a String Using Ordinal Values with\n",
    "Weighting](figures/string-hash-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be able to think of a number of additional ways to compute hash\n",
    "values for items in a collection. The important thing to remember is\n",
    "that the hash function has to be efficient so that it does not become\n",
    "the dominant part of the storage and search process. If the hash\n",
    "function is too complex, then it becomes more work to compute the slot\n",
    "name than it would be to simply do a basic sequential or binary search\n",
    "as described earlier. This would quickly defeat the purpose of hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision Resolution\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We now return to the problem of collisions. When two items hash to the\n",
    "same slot, we must have a systematic method for placing the second item\n",
    "in the hash table. This process is called **collision resolution**. As\n",
    "we stated earlier, if the hash function is perfect, collisions will\n",
    "never occur. However, since this is often not possible, collision\n",
    "resolution becomes a very important part of hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One method for resolving collisions looks into the hash table and tries\n",
    "to find another open slot to hold the item that caused the collision. A\n",
    "simple way to do this is to start at the original hash value position\n",
    "and then move in a sequential manner through the slots until we\n",
    "encounter the first slot that is empty. Note that we may need to go back\n",
    "to the first slot (circularly) to cover the entire hash table. This\n",
    "collision resolution process is referred to as **open addressing** in\n",
    "that it tries to find the next open slot or address in the hash table.\n",
    "By systematically visiting each slot one at a time, we are performing an\n",
    "open addressing technique called **linear probing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The illustration below shows an extended set of integer\n",
    "items under the simple remainder method hash function\n",
    "(54, 26, 93, 17, 77, 31, 44, 55, 20). When we\n",
    "attempt to place 44 into slot 0, a collision occurs. Under linear\n",
    "probing, we look sequentially, slot by slot, until we find an open\n",
    "position. In this case, we find slot 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, 55 should go in slot 0 but must be placed in slot 2 since it is\n",
    "the next open position. The final value of 20 hashes to slot 9. Since\n",
    "slot 9 is full, we begin to do linear probing. We visit slots 10, 0, 1,\n",
    "and 2, and finally find an empty slot at position 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Collision resolution with linear probing](figures/linear-probing-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have built a hash table using open addressing and linear\n",
    "probing, it is essential that we utilize the same methods to search for\n",
    "items. Assume we want to look up the item 93. When we compute the hash\n",
    "value, we get 5. Looking in slot 5 reveals 93, and we can return `True`.\n",
    "What if we are looking for 20? Now the hash value is 9, and slot 9 is\n",
    "currently holding 31. We cannot simply return `False` since we know that\n",
    "there could have been collisions. We are now forced to do a sequential\n",
    "search, starting at position 10, looking until either we find the item\n",
    "20 or we find an empty slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage to linear probing is the tendency for **clustering**;\n",
    "items become clustered in the table. This means that if many collisions\n",
    "occur at the same hash value, a number of surrounding slots will be\n",
    "filled by the linear probing resolution. This will have an impact on\n",
    "other items that are being inserted, as we saw when we tried to add the\n",
    "item 20 above. A cluster of values hashing to 0 had to be skipped to\n",
    "finally find an open position. This cluster is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A cluster of items for slot 0](figures/clustering.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to deal with clustering is to extend the linear probing\n",
    "technique so that instead of looking sequentially for the next open\n",
    "slot, we skip slots, thereby more evenly distributing the items that\n",
    "have caused collisions. This will potentially reduce the clustering that\n",
    "occurs. The illustration below shows the items when collision resolution\n",
    "is done with a “plus 3” probe. This means that once a collision occurs,\n",
    "we will look at every third slot until we find one that is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Collision resolution using “plus 3”](figures/linear-probing-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The general name for this process of looking for another slot after a\n",
    "collision is **rehashing**. With simple linear probing, the rehash\n",
    "function is $newhashvalue = rehash(oldhashvalue)$ where\n",
    "$rehash(pos) = (pos + 1) \\% sizeoftable$. The “plus 3” rehash can be\n",
    "defined as $rehash(pos) = (pos+3) \\% sizeoftable$. In general,\n",
    "$rehash(pos) = (pos + skip) \\% sizeoftable$. It is important to note\n",
    "that the size of the “skip” must be such that all the slots in the table\n",
    "will eventually be visited. Otherwise, part of the table will be unused.\n",
    "To ensure this, it is often suggested that the table size be a prime\n",
    "number. This is the reason we have been using 11 in our examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variation of the linear probing idea is called **quadratic probing**.\n",
    "Instead of using a constant “skip” value, we use a rehash function that\n",
    "increments the hash value by 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. This means that\n",
    "if the first hash value is *h*, the successive values are $h+1$, $h+4$,\n",
    "$h+9$, $h+16$, and so on. In other words, quadratic probing uses a skip\n",
    "consisting of successive perfect squares.\n",
    "The illustration below shows our example values after they are\n",
    "placed using this technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Collision resolution with quadratic probing](figures/quadratic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative method for handling the collision problem is to allow\n",
    "each slot to hold a reference to a collection (or chain) of items.\n",
    "**Chaining** allows many items to exist at the same location in the hash\n",
    "table. When collisions happen, the item is still placed in the proper\n",
    "slot of the hash table. As more and more items hash to the same\n",
    "location, the difficulty of searching for the item in the collection\n",
    "increases. The illustration below shows the items as they are\n",
    "added to a hash table that uses chaining to resolve collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Collision resolution with chaining](figures/chaining.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to search for an item, we use the hash function to generate\n",
    "the slot where it should reside. Since each slot holds a collection, we\n",
    "use a searching technique to decide whether the item is present. The\n",
    "advantage is that on the average there are likely to be many fewer items\n",
    "in each slot, so the search is perhaps more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of Hashing\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We stated earlier that in the best case hashing would provide a $O(1)$,\n",
    "constant time search technique. However, due to collisions, the number\n",
    "of comparisons is typically not so simple. Even though a complete\n",
    "analysis of hashing is beyond the scope of this text, we can state some\n",
    "well-known results that approximate the number of comparisons necessary\n",
    "to search for an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important piece of information we need to analyze the use of a\n",
    "hash table is the load factor, $\\lambda$. Conceptually, if $\\lambda$ is\n",
    "small, then there is a lower chance of collisions, meaning that items\n",
    "are more likely to be in the slots where they belong. If $\\lambda$ is\n",
    "large, meaning that the table is filling up, then there are more and\n",
    "more collisions. This means that collision resolution is more difficult,\n",
    "requiring more comparisons to find an empty slot. With chaining,\n",
    "increased collisions means an increased number of items on each chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we will have a result for both a successful and an\n",
    "unsuccessful search. For a successful search using open addressing with\n",
    "linear probing, the average number of comparisons is approximately\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda}\\right)$ and an unsuccessful\n",
    "search gives\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda}\\right)^2\\right)$ If we are\n",
    "using chaining, the average number of comparisons is\n",
    "$1 + \\frac {\\lambda}{2}$ for the successful case, and simply $\\lambda$\n",
