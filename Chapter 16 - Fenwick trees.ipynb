    "In a way, these two solutions complement each other. One is performing the update fast and the query slow, while the other one does the opposite. The goal of a faster data structure is to find some sort of middle ground.\n",
    "It's helpful to consider that in each of these naive solutions we maintain for each position $i$ an interval that ends in that position. In the first solution we maintain the interval $[i, i]$, of length $1$, while in the seconds solution we maintain the interval $[1, i]$, of length $i$.\n",
    "When we want to calculate the sum of all values up to a certain index, in both solutions we keep adding the sum for the interval ending at our current index, and then skip to the first value that's not in our interval.\n",
    "When we update the value at a certain index, we need to update all intervals that contain that index.\n",
    "#2 Fenwick tree structure\n",
    "To improve on the previous solutions, we need to have a balance between long and short intervals, so we can skip ever increasing intervals and we don't need to update too many intervals when a value changes. If all intervals have the same length for instance, the best balance is when we use $\\left \\lfloor{\\sqrt N}\\right \\rfloor$ as the length of our intervals. This is a common technique when you know one of your operations takes $B$ steps, and the other one $N/B$ steps, we would pick $B=\\left \\lfloor{\\sqrt N}\\right \\rfloor$, to minimize the worst case.\n",
    "But we can get even better results if we consider the length of the interval ending at $i$ to be the largest power of $2$ that's a divisor of $i$.\n",

    "<FenwickTree size={16} style={{margin: \"0 auto\", display: \"block\"}} width={660} height={90} showFather={true}/>\n",
    "These intervals may seem a bit chaotic at a first glance. \n",
    "Let's say $F_i$ is the length of the interval ending at index $i$. Basically are dealing with intervals of the form $[i-F_i+1, i]$. For the example above $F=[1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 16]$. \n",
    "We can show how to build $F$ incrementally over lengths that are powers of $2$.\n",
    "- If $N = 1$, it only makes sense to maintain an interval of length $1$, so $F=[1]$:\n",
    "<FenwickTree size={1} style={{margin: \"0 auto\", display: \"block\"}} width={660} height={50} showFather={true}/>\n",

    "<FenwickTree size={2} style={{margin: \"0 auto\", display: \"block\"}} width={660} height={55} showFather={true}/>\n",
    "- To find $F$ for the next power of $2$, we take the previous $F$, append a copy of it, and change the last element to be equal to $N$. So in the case of $N=4$, appending a copy to the previous $F$ means we get $[1, 2, 1, 2]$, but then we change the last element, so the new $F=[1, 2, 1, 4]$\n",

    "<FenwickTree size={8} style={{margin: \"0 auto\", display: \"block\"}} width={660} height={75} showFather={true}/>\n",

    "#3 But where is the tree?\n",
    "So far, this data structures seems to be just about maintaining some interval sums, there's no explicit tree involved. But at a closer look, we can see that any two intervals are either disjoint, or one of them is completely contained by the other. This means we can interpret the set of intervals as a <Definition term=\"rooted tree\"/> (actually a forest), where the father of an interval is the shortest interval that contains it.\n",
    "For example, the father of $2$ (the interval ending at index $2$) is $4$, the father of $7$ is $8$, and the father of $12$ is $16$. Below, you can hover over an element to highlight its interval and its father interval, in case it exists.\n",

    "#3 Interval length\n",
    "First, given an index $i$, how do you calculate the length of the interval ending at $i$? We defined it as the largest power of $2$ that's a divisor of $i$. It would be nice to have a formula though. This value is know as the /least significant bit/, abbreviated /lsb/, of $i$'s representation. We can write the following function:"
