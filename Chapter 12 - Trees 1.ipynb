    "The tree is a very commonly encountered data shape that allows us to represent hierarchical relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that _many_ of the structures we encounter when writing software are hierarchical. For instance, every file and directory within a file system is “inside” one and only one parent directory, up to the root directory. In an HTML document, every tag is inside one and only one parent tag, up to the root (`html`) tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also turns out that that we can use trees to implement useful data structures like maps, and to do fast searches. We will cover some of the many use cases for trees in this section, as well as exploring algorithms to traverse through trees.\n",

    "Examples of trees\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree data structures have many things in common with their botanical\n",
    "cousins. Both have a root, branches, and leaves. One difference is that\n",
    "we find it more intuitive to consider the root of a tree data structure\n",
    "to be at the “top”, for instance that the root of a file system is\n",
    "“above” its subdirectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin our study of tree data structures, let’s look at a few\n",
    "common examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first example of a tree is a classification tree\n",
    "from biology. The illustration below shows an example of the\n",
    "biological classification of some animals. From this simple example, we\n",
    "can learn about several properties of trees. The first property this\n",
    "example demonstrates is that trees are hierarchical. By hierarchical, we\n",
    "mean that trees are structured in layers with the more general things\n",
    "near the top and the more specific things near the bottom. The top of\n",
    "the hierarchy is the Kingdom, the next layer of the tree (the “children”\n",
    "of the layer above) is the Phylum, then the Class, and so on. However,\n",
    "no matter how deep we go in the classification tree, all the organisms\n",
    "are still animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Taxonomy of some common animals shown as a\n",
    "tree](figures/biology.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that you can start at the top of the tree and follow a path made\n",
    "of circles and arrows all the way to the bottom. At each level of the\n",
    "tree we might ask ourselves a question and then follow the path that\n",
    "agrees with our answer. For example we might ask, “Is this animal a\n",
    "Chordate or an Arthropod?” If the answer is “Chordate” then we follow\n",
    "that path and ask, “Is this Chordate a Mammal?” If not, we are stuck\n",
    "(but only in this simplified example). When we are at the Mammal level\n",
    "we ask, “Is this Mammal a Primate or a Carnivore?” We can keep following\n",
    "paths until we get to the very bottom of the tree where we have the\n",
    "common name.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second property of trees is that all of the children of one node are\n",
    "independent of the children of another node. For example, the Genus\n",
    "Felis has the children Domestica and Leo. The Genus Musca also has a\n",
    "child named Domestica, but it is a different node and is independent of\n",
    "the Domestica child of Felis. This means that we can change the node\n",
    "that is the child of Musca without affecting the child of Felis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third property is that each leaf node is unique. We can specify a path\n",
    "from the root of the tree to a leaf that uniquely identifies each\n",
    "species in the animal kingdom; for example, Animalia $\\rightarrow$\n",
    "Chordate $\\rightarrow$ Mammal $\\rightarrow$ Carnivora $\\rightarrow$\n",
    "Felidae $\\rightarrow$ Felis $\\rightarrow$ Domestica.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of a tree structure that you probably use every day is a\n",
    "file system. In a file system, directories, or folders, are structured\n",
    "as a tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A small part of the unix file system\n",
    "hierarchy](figures/directory.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The file system tree has much in common with the biological\n",
    "classification tree. You can follow a path from the root to any\n",
    "directory. That path will uniquely identify that subdirectory (and all\n",
    "the files in it). Another important property of trees, derived from\n",
    "their hierarchical nature, is that you can move entire sections of a\n",
    "tree (called a **subtree**) to a different position in the tree without\n",
    "affecting the lower levels of the hierarchy. For example, we could take\n",
    "the entire subtree starting with /etc/, detach etc/ from the root and\n",
    "reattach it under usr/. This would change the unique pathname to httpd\n",
    "from /etc/httpd to /usr/etc/httpd, but would not affect the contents or\n",
    "any children of the httpd directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have looked at examples of trees, we will formally define a\n",
    "tree and its components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node\n",
    "\n",
    "A node is a fundamental part of a tree. It can have a unique name, which we\n",
    "sometimes call the “key.” A node may also have additional information, which we\n",
    "refer to in this book as the “payload.” While the payload information is not\n",
    "central to many tree algorithms, it is often critical in applications that make\n",
    "use of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge\n",
    "\n",
    "An edge is another fundamental part of a tree. An edge connects two nodes to\n",
    "show that there is a relationship between them. Every node other than the root\n",
    "is connected by exactly one incoming edge from another node. Each node may have\n",
    "several outgoing edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root\n",
    "\n",
    "The root of the tree is the only node in the tree that has no incoming edges. In\n",
    "a file system, `/` is the root of the tree. In an HTML document, the `<html>`\n",
    "tag is the root of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path\n",
    "\n",
    "A path is an ordered list of nodes that are connected by edges. For\n",
    "example, $Mammal \\rightarrow Carnivora \\rightarrow Felidae \\rightarrow Felis \\rightarrow Domestica$ is a path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Children\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of nodes $c$ that have incoming edges from the same node are said\n",
    "to be the children of that node. In our file system example, nodes log/, spool/,\n",
    "and yp/ are the children of node var/.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parent\n",
    "\n",
    "A node is the parent of all the nodes to which it connects with outgoing edges.\n",
    "In our file system example the node var/ is the parent of nodes log/, spool/,\n",
    "and yp/.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sibling\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes in the tree that are children of the same parent are said to be siblings.\n",
    "The nodes etc/ and usr/ are siblings in the file system tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subtree\n",
    "\n",
    "A subtree is a set of nodes and edges comprised of a parent and all the\n",
    "descendants of that parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leaf Node\n",
    "\n",
    "A leaf node is a node that has no children. For example, Human and Chimpanzee\n",
    "are leaf nodes in our animal taxonomy example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level\n",
    "\n",
    "The level of a node $n$ is the number of edges on the path from the root node\n",
    "to $n$. For example, the level of the Felis node in our animal taxonomy\n",
    "example is five. By definition, the level of the root node is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Height\n",
    "\n",
    "The height of a tree is equal to the maximum level of any node in the tree. The\n",
    "height of the tree in our file system example is two.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the basic vocabulary now defined, we can move on to two formal definitions\n",
    "of a tree: one involving nodes and edges, and the other a recursive definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Definition one:* A tree consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges\n",
    "that connect pairs of nodes. A tree has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   One node of the tree is designated as the root node.\n",
    "-   Every node $n$, except the root node, is connected by an edge from\n",
    "    exactly one other node $p$, where $p$ is the parent of $n$.\n",
    "-   A unique path traverses from the root to each node.\n",
    "-   If each node in the tree has a maximum of two children, we say that\n",
    "    the tree is a **binary tree**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below illustrates a tree that fits definition one. The arrowheads on\n",

However, when building functionality around our own trees it is generally simpler to use a representation constructed from dicts and lists, which we discuss later. This simpler representation is also more portable to other languages and contexts, even those without a notion of objects (such as pen and paper!).\n",

    "We will start out with a simple class definition for the nodes and\n",
    "references approach as shown below. In this case we will consider binary\n",

    "nodes may have more than two children, a `children` list could be used to\n",
    "contain these references instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to remember about this representation is that the attributes\n",
    "`left` and `right` will become references to other instances of the `Node`\n",
    "class. For example, when we insert a new left child into the tree we create\n",
    "another instance of `Node` and modify `self.left` in the root to reference the\n",
    "new subtree.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We must consider two cases for insertion. The first case is characterized by a\n",
    "node with no existing left child. When there is no left child, simply add a node\n",
    "to the tree. The second case is characterized by a node with an existing left\n",
    "child. In the second case, we insert a node and push the existing child down one\n",
    "level in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for `insert_right` must consider a symmetric set of cases. There will\n",
    "either be no right child, or we must insert the node between the root and an\n",
    "existing right child:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def insert_right(self, child):\n",
    "    if self.right is None:\n",

    "        child.right = self.right\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "    current token. Add a new node as the right child of the current node\n",
    "    and descend to the right child.\n",
    "3.  If the current token is a number, set the root value of the current\n",
    "    node to the number and return to the parent.\n",
    "4.  If the current token is a `')'`, go to the parent of the\n",
    "    current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing the Python code, let’s look at an example of the rules\n",
    "outlined above in action. We will use the expression $$(3 + (4 \\times 5))$$. We\n",

    "4.  Read + as the next token. By rule 2, set the root value of the\n",
    "    current node to + and add a new node as the right child. The new\n",
    "    right child becomes the current node.\n",
    "5.  Read a ( as the next token. By rule 1, create a new node as the left\n",
    "    child of the current node. The new left child becomes the\n",
    "    current node.\n",
    "6.  Read a 4 as the next token. By rule 3, set the value of the current\n",
    "    node to 4. Make the parent of 4 the current node.\n",
    "7.  Read \\* as the next token. By rule 2, set the root value of the\n",
    "    current node to \\* and create a new right child. The new right child\n",
    "    becomes the current node.\n",
    "8.  Read 5 as the next token. By rule 3, set the root value of the\n",

    "    current node. At this point there is no parent for + so we are done.\n",

    "From the example above, it is clear that we need to keep track of the current\n",

    "$$70, 31, 93, 94, 14, 23, 73$$. Since 70 was the first key inserted into the\n",
