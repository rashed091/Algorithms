    "One important variation of the queue is the **priority queue**. A priority queue\n",
    "acts like a queue in that items remain in it for some time before being\n",
    "dequeued. However, in a priority queue the logical order of items inside a queue\n",
    "is determined by their “priority”. Specifically, the highest priority items are\n",
    "retrieved from the queue ahead of lower priority items.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that the priority queue is a useful data structure for specific\n",
    "algorithms such as Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm. More generally though,\n",
    "priority queues are useful enough that you may have encountered one already:\n",
    "message queues or tasks queues for instance typically prioritize some items over\n",
    "others.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can probably think of a couple of easy ways to implement a priority queue\n",
    "using sorting functions and arrays or lists. However, sorting a list is $O(n\n",
    "\\log{n})$. We can do better.\n",

    "The classic way to implement a priority queue is using a data structure called a\n",
    "**binary heap**. A binary heap will allow us to enqueue or dequeue items in\n",
    "$O(\\log{n})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary heap is interesting to study because when we diagram the heap it\n",
    "looks a lot like a tree, but when we implement it we use only a single dynamic\n",
    "array (such as a Python list) as its internal representation. The binary heap\n",
    "has two common variations: the **min heap**, in which the smallest key is always\n",
    "at the front, and the **max heap**, in which the largest key value is always at\n",
    "the front. In this section we will implement the min heap, but the max heap is\n",
    "implemented in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic operations we will implement for our binary heap are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `BinaryHeap()` creates a new, empty, binary heap.\n",
    "-   `insert(k)` adds a new item to the heap.\n",
    "-   `find_min()` returns the item with the minimum key value, leaving\n",
    "    item in the heap.\n",
    "-   `del_min()` returns the item with the minimum key value, removing the\n",
    "    item from the heap.\n",
    "-   `is_empty()` returns true if the heap is empty, false otherwise.\n",
    "-   `size()` returns the number of items in the heap.\n",
    "-   `build_heap(list)` builds a new heap from a list of keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Structure Property\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for our heap to work efficiently, we will take advantage of\n",
    "the logarithmic nature of the binary tree to represent our heap. In\n",
    "order to guarantee logarithmic performance, we must keep our tree\n",
    "balanced. A balanced binary tree has roughly the same number of nodes in\n",
    "the left and right subtrees of the root. In our heap implementation we\n",
    "keep the tree balanced by creating a **complete binary tree**. A\n",
    "complete binary tree is a tree in which each level has all of its nodes.\n",
    "The exception to this is the bottom level of the tree, which we fill in\n",
    "from left to right. This diagram shows an example of a\n",
    "complete binary tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ ](figures/complete-binary-tree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting property of a complete tree is that we can represent it\n",
    "using a single list. We do not need to use nodes and references or even lists of\n",
    "lists. Because the tree is complete, the left child of a parent (at position\n",
    "$p$) is the node that is found in position $2p$ in the list. Similarly, the\n",
    "right child of the parent is at position $2p + 1$ in the list. To find the\n",
    "parent of any node in the tree, we can simply use integer division (like normal\n",
    "mathematical division except we discard the remainder). Given that a node is at\n",
    "position $n$ in the list, the parent is at position $n/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below shows a complete binary tree and also gives the list\n",
    "representation of the tree. Note the $2p$ and $2p+1$ relationship between\n",
    "parent and children. The list representation of the tree, along with the full\n",
    "structure property, allows us to efficiently traverse a complete binary tree\n",
    "using only a few simple mathematical operations. We will see that this also\n",
    "leads to an efficient implementation of our binary heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Heap Order Property\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that we will use to store items in a heap relies on maintaining the\n",
    "heap order property. The **heap order property** is as follows: In a heap, for\n",
    "every node $x$ with parent $p$, the key in $p$ is smaller than or equal to\n",
    "the key in $x$. The diagram below also illustrates a complete binary tree that\n",
    "has the heap order property.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A complete binary tree, along with its list representation](figures/heap-order.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap Operations\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin our implementation of a binary heap with the constructor.\n",
    "Since the entire binary heap can be represented by a single list, all\n",
    "the constructor will do is initialize the list and an attribute\n",
    "`current_size` to keep track of the current size of the heap.\n",
    "The code below shows the Python code for the constructor.\n",
    "You will notice that an empty binary heap has a single zero as the first\n",
    "element of `items` and that this zero is not used, but is there so\n",
    "that simple integer division can be used in later steps."

    "The next method we will implement is `insert`. The easiest, and most\n",

    "that we will maintain the complete tree property. The bad news about\n",
    "appending is that we will very likely violate the heap structure\n",
