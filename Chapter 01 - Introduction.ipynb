    "Take a moment to answer this for yourself üôÇ. If you were given two programs that solve the same problem, how would you decide between them?\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- concealed -->\n",
    "The truth is there are many valid criteria, which are often in conflict.\n",
    "<!-- /concealed -->\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically want our program to be _correct_. In other words, we‚Äôd like the program‚Äôs output to match our expectations. Unfortunately, correctness is not always clear. For instance what does it mean for Google to return the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù top 10 search results for your search query?\n",
    "\n",
    "Good software engineers often want their code to be _readable_, _reusable_, _elegant_ or _testable_. These are admirable goals, but you may not be able to achieve them all at the same time. It‚Äôs also not entirely clear what something like ‚Äúelegance‚Äù looks like, and we certainly haven‚Äôt been able to model it mathematically, so computer scientists haven‚Äôt given these aspects of programs much consideration ü§∑‚Äç.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two factors that computer scientists _love_ to model mathematically, though, are how long a program will take to run, and how much space (typically, memory) it will use. We call these time and space efficiency, and they‚Äôll be at the core of our study of algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may need to trade these off against other concerns: algorithm A may be faster but use more memory than algorithm B. They might both be less elegant than algorithm C, in a context where elegance is the priority. We‚Äôll be focusing on time and space because they happen to be both interesting and measurable, but please don‚Äôt go away thinking they‚Äôre always the most important factors. The only truly correct answer is: ‚Äúit depends‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect of ‚Äúit depends‚Äù, even when we focus on just time or space, is the context in which the program runs. There is often a relationship between the inputs of a program and its running time or space usage. For instance if you `grep` over many large files, it will take longer than if you `grep` over fewer, smaller files. This relationship between inputs and behavior will be an important part of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond this, the exact time and space that your program uses will also depend on many other factors. Can you think of at least three?\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- concealed -->\n",
    "Here are some:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How long it takes your computer to execute every instruction\n",
    "* Your computer‚Äôs ‚ÄúInstruction Set Architecture‚Äù, for instance ARM or Intel x86\n",
    "* How many cores of your machine the program uses\n",
    "* What language your program is written in\n",
    "* How your operating system chooses to schedule processes\n",
    "* What other programs are running at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "&hellip; and there are many more.\n",
    "<!-- /concealed -->\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are important in practice, but none address the core question of whether an algorithm is generally better or worse than another. Sometimes we‚Äôd like to be able to ask: generally speaking, irrespective of whether a program is written in Fortran for the IBM 704 or in Python running on a shiny new Macbook, will it be more time and/or space efficient than an alternative? Will it use less space? This is the crux of algorithm analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p class=\"crux\">\n",
    "Algorithm analysis is a way to compare the time and space efficiency of programs with respect to their possible inputs, but irrespective of other context.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, we measure the time used by a program in some unit of&hellip; err&hellip; time, such as seconds. Similarly we measure space used in something like bytes. In analysis, this would be too specific. If we measure the time that it takes to finish, this number would incorporate details like language choice and CPU speed. We will need new models and vocabulary in order to speak with the level of generality that we‚Äôre seeking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs explore this idea with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say I wanted to calculate the sum of the first n numbers, and I‚Äôm wondering how long this will take. Firstly, can you think of a simple algorithm to do the calculation? It should be a function that has n as a parameter, and returns the sum of the first n numbers. You don‚Äôt need to do anything fancy, but please do take the time to write out an algorithm and think about how long it will take to run on small or large inputs.\n",
