    "In this lesson we will show a data structure that comes up quite often in competitive programming. The $segment tree$'s main purpose is to solve problems (or subproblems) that receive a flow of $queries$ and $updates$ on an array and need to solve the queries online. Let's take an example:\n",
    "You are given an array $a$ of $N$ integers, numbered $1$ through $N$, and $M$ operations, each one either:\n",
    "- $update$: given $x$ and $y$, change $a[x]$ to $y$\n",
    "- $query$: given $x$ and $y$, find $max(a[x], a[x+1]...a[y])$\n",
    "Give the answer to each query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Straight forward solution\n",
    "For the rest of the lesson, we will denote a subarray of the given array as a $segment$.\n",
    "The first idea that comes to mind when solving this problem is to go through all elements in the segment of the query and just find the maximum value among them in $O(y-x)=O(N)$ while at an update just change $a[x]$ to $y$, $O(1)$ time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Optimization idea\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity of explanation, let's assume $N$ is a power of $2$, so $N=2^k$. \n",
    "Now, you can think of the solution above in this way: we have the calculated solution for every segment of length $1$ (the maximum value of segment $i..i$ is $a[i]$). They are updated in $O(1)$, but a query is formed from $O(N)$ such segments. What if we were to have the solution calculated for a few /more/ segments, inteligently maintained, so that even though maybe you would have to recalculate more than one segment in an update, the number of segments needed for a query would decrease significantly?\n",
    "Great, but now what segments should we maintain?\n",
    "We will maintain a total of $2N-1$ segments: one of length $N$, two of length $N/2$, $4$ of length $N/4$ and so on, and their structure will look like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Every segment of length $2^k$ will split into $2$ segments of length $2^{k-1}$, which from now on we will call its $sons$. The segment itself will be the $father$ of these two segments.\n",
    "Of course, now comes the idea to maintain the segments in a <Definition term=\"tree$-like structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Segment trees\n",
    "A segment tree has the structure of a full binary tree, so it can be stocked in the memory in the same way as a  heap, as a simple array, where the root of the tree is $0$, the father of a segment $i$ is $\\left \\lfloor{(i-1)/2}\\right \\rfloor$ and its two sons are $2i+1$ and $2i+2$. Here is the representation of the segments above in tree fashion:\n",
    "    \n",
    "If $N$ is not a power of $2$, the only thing that changes is that if you have an odd-lengthed segment, the left side will be of length $\\left \\lceil{L/2}\\right \\rceil$ while the right side will be of length $\\left \\lfloor{L/2}\\right \\rfloor$. The tree will no longer be /full/, but all other properties still hold. You can check out how it looks like by clicking on the `custom input` button.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building the tree\n",
    "For the segment tree to work, you need to be able to calculate the /solution/ for a segment from the solutions of its sons. For the sample problem, the maximum value on a segment is the maximum between the answers in its two sons, so the calculation looks like this:"

Each segment will have an associated $lazy$ value besides the needed info (in this case, the sum) that represents an update that needs to be applied to the $whole segment$. So an update will split its segment the same way the query does, and set the $lazy$ value on each segment reached to be equal to <Latex value=\"v\">. Then, whenever we enter into a node, regardless whether through an update or a query, we will call a function, `propagate`, that updates the info in the current segment and passes the lazy value down to its sons.
